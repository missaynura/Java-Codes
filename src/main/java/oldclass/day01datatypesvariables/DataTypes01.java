        1. public: it means it can be used from entire the project.(public library)
        there is no any restriction to use it.
        public is one of the access modifiers.
    
        we have 4 access modifiers: 1. public, 2. protected, 3 default, 4. private
        2. default: it means it is open to a group. (Harvard UNI Library)
        If you make something default in Java, it will be used just inside the package.
        To make something default in Java, do not type any access modifier.
    
        3. protected: it means it is open to a group + their kids
        (gym is open to employees and their kids)
    
        4. private: it means it is specific for a person. (driving license)
        If you make something private, you can use it just while in the class,
        when you go outside the class it is impossible to use it.
    
        when you create something in Java, you should name it.
        How to name a class: 1. start with upper case, 2 if you have multiple word
        every word should start with upper case. 3. other characters should be in lower case.
        4. you can use digits in naming.
    
        the part between opening curly braces { and closing } is called class body.
