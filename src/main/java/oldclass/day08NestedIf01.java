        //Type java code by using nested if statement,
        //If a number is even then check if it is divisible by 3 or not. If it is divisible by 3 the output will be
        //“Perfect even number” otherwise, the output will be “Good even number.”
        //If the number is odd then check if it is divisible by 3 or not. If it is divisible by 3 the output will be
        //“Perfect odd number” otherwise, the output will be “Good odd number.”

        //Type java code by using nested if() statement.
        //Write a program to check if a year is leap year or not.
        //If the year is divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 400.
        //If a year is not divisible by 100 then it must be divisible by 4.


        //Type java code by using nested if() statement.
        //Ask user to enter a password
        //If the initial of the password is uppercase then check if it is ‘A’ or not.
        //If it is ‘A’ the output will be “Valid Password”
        //otherwise the output will be “Invalid Password”
        //For example; Ali ==> Valid password - ali ==> Invalid - Mark ==> Invalid
        //If the initial of the password is lowercase then check if it is ‘z’ or not.
        //If it is ‘z’ the output will be “Valid Password”
        //otherwise the output will be “Invalid Password”
        //For example; zoe ==> Valid password - Zoe ==> Invalid -
