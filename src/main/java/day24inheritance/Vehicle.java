    1) Variables and methods with the same name come from bottom to top in inheritance
    2) "this" keyword is for getting variable value from the class itself or calling the method from the class itself
    3) "super" keyword is for getting variable value from the parent class or calling the method from the parent class
    4) Java runs constructors from top to bottom in inheritance because without having parent,
       it's impossible to have child
    5) "super()" is for calling constructors from first level parent class
    6) "super()" exists as default in every constructor, normally it is invisible, if you want you can type it explicitly
    7) By putting appropriate parameters inside the "super()" parenthesis, you can select whatever constructor
       you want from the parent class.
    8) this() is for calling constructors form the class itself
